# CytoLogiq Therapeutics — Fundraising Site

CytoLogiq™ provides a system and method for utilizing a dynamic range of cytokine and inflammatory biomarkers to:
1. Detect pathophysiologic states (precachexia, cachexia, cytokine flare, immunosuppression).
2. Inform timing, sequence, or combination of biologic and immune-based therapies.
3. Adapt to evolving serologic, genomic, or pathologic data inputs.

The system supports integration with therapeutic antibodies including Serologiq™, IL-12 fusions, IL-15 agonists, checkpoint inhibitors, and TRAIL-based apoptotic agents.
